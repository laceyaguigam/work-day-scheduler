# Work Day Scheduler
## Purpose

Daily Schedulers are a great way for people to to stay organize and continue to be productive through out the day. The following web application was created to help people or business keep track of their daily events using a color-coded system in order to stay productive throughout the day.
 
The scheduler should meet the following criteria: 

* the current day must be displayed at the top of the calendar
* standard business hours time blocks must be displayed for the current day 
* each time block must be color-coded to indicate whether it's in the past, present, or future
* an event can be entered when a time block is clicked
* when an event is saved, it must be stored in local storage
* when page is refreshed the saved events persist

## Installation 

Clone the source code for the Work Day Scheduler from the scheduler repository and save to desired location. The source code can then be used in your desired coding software.

## Usage 

Open the Work Day Scheduler folder in vs code or using any coding software and open the index.html file in desired browser. Once the index.html file is opened, the user will then see a color coded daily schedule. The user may click on a time block and enter an event to be saved in the scheduler. The grey time blocks is time that has already past, the red time block is the current time, and the green time bloacks is time found in the future or later in the day.
